# BrewFinder

## Description
This web app is designed to help users find breweries in a particular city.  The app uses the Open Brewery Database API to fetch brewery data and the Google Maps API to display brewery markers on a map.  Users can also have an option to view the breweries in a list where they can filter the locations based on brewery type and sort them by distance.  Additionally, users can click on a brewery marker to view more details about a particular brewery, such as its name, address, phone number, and website link.  Users can also get directions to a particular brewery from their current location using the Google Maps API. With BrewFinder, users can plan their brewery visits accordingly and enjoy exploring local breweries in their chosen city.
